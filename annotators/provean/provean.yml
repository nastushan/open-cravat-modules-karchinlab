output_columns:
- name: provean_score
  title: Score
  type: float
  desc: Scores range from -14 to 14. The smaller the score the more likely the SNP has damaging effect.

  title: Converted rankscore
  desc: The rankscore is the ratio of the rank the PROVEAN score over the total number of PROVEAN scores in dbNSFP.

  type: float
  desc: If score <= -2.5 the corresponding nsSNV is predicted as "D(amaging)"; otherwise it is predicted as "N(eutral)".
