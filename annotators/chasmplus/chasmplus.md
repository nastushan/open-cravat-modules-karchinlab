# About CHASMplus

CHASMplus is a computational tool to classify missense mutations as drivers or passengers in human cancers. Driver mutations provide a selective advantage to cancer cells, while passenger mutations do not. CHASMplus is based on a set of 95 features, characterizing mutational hotspots, evolutionary conservation/human germline variation, molecular function annotations (e.g., protein-protein interface annotations, sequence biased regions, and relevant covariates (e.g., replication timing). It was trained using somatic mutations from whole-exome sequencing of a larger number of tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CHASMplus can score mutations in either a cancer type-specific manner or "pan-cancer", which is a useful default for many cancer types.

## How do I interpret the results?

The CHASMplus output contains two main components: a score and a p-value. High scores reflect a greater likelihood that a mutation is a driver (scores range from 0.0 to 1.0). The P-value reflects the statistical significance of obtaining the acheived or higher CHASMplus score. We recommend that driver mutations are called based on the False Discovery Rate, preferably by using the Benjamini-Hochberg method through a function like the `p.adjust` function in the R programming language. Possible thresholds include a false discovery rate of 0.1 or 0.01, depending on the need to constrain false positives. NOTE: P-values are calibrated for whole-exome sequencing studies. If you are using a targeted gene panel or focusing on only a specific subset of genes, then the P-values will not adequately control the error rate.

## How are CHASMplus scores generated?

CHASMplus scores all possible missense mutations on all transcripts. Therefore keep in mind that the same genomic mutation may have slightly varying scores depending on the transcript. OpenCRAVAT decides which among many transcripts will be chosen as the default. All scores provided through OpenCRAVAT are weighted by their respective gene based on 20/20+ (gene weighted CHASMplus scores).
