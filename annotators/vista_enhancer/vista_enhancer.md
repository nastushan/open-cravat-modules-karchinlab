# Enhancer	

The VISTA Enhancer Browser is a central resource for experimentally validated human and mouse noncoding fragments with gene enhancer activity as assessed in transgenic mice. Most of these noncoding elements were selected for testing based on their extreme conservation in other vertebrates or epigenomic evidence (ChIP-Seq) of putative enhancer marks. The results of this in vivo enhancer screen are provided through this publicly available website.

This program is located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

As of 2/5/2019 the database contains information on 2959 in vivo tested elements - 1595 elements with enhancer activity.
