  title: HDIV Prediction
  type: string
  desc: PolyPhen-2 prediction based on HumDiv, "D" ("probably damaging", HDIV Raw
    score in [0.957,1] or rankscore in [0.55859,0.91137]), "P" ("possibly damaging",
    HDIV Raw score in [0.454,0.956] or rankscore in [0.37043,0.55681]) and "B" ("benign",
    HDIV Raw score in [0,0.452] or rankscore in [0.03061,0.36974]). Score cutoff for
    binary classification is 0.5 for HDIV score or 0.38028 for rankscore, i.e. the
    prediction is "neutral" if the HDIV score is smaller than 0.5, and "deleterious"
    if the HDIV score is larger than 0.5. Multiple entries are separated by ";", corresponding
    to Uniprot ID.
